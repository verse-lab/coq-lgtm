# Artefact for LGTM

## Building Instructions

The version of Coq used in our development is **8.18.0**, where the version of underlying OCaml compiler is **4.13.1**. We recommend installing Coq and the required packages via OPAM. [The official page of OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) describes how to install and configure OPAM, and [the official page of Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html) describes how to install Coq and Coq packages with OPAM. 

We have tested on our machine that after executing `opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released` according to the official page of Coq, running the following commands can install all required packages for compiling our project:

```
opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect=2.1.0
opam install coq-mathcomp-zify coq-mathcomp-algebra coq-mathcomp-fingroup coq-mathcomp-finmap
opam install coq-flocq
opam install coq-vcfloat --ignore-constraints-on=coq
```

The flag `--ignore-constraints-on` is necessary for working around some version constraints. 

For reference, we list the versions of all Coq-related packages (installed by the commands above) as follows. 

```

coq-bignums            9.0.0+coq8.18

### Build the Coq Project

Execute the following command in the terminal: 

```
make
```

Please note that warnings (in yellow colour) may appear during the compilation, but they will not cause the compilation to fail.
