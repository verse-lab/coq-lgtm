# Artefact for LGTM

## Building Instructions

The version of Coq used in our development is **8.18.0**, where the version of underlying OCaml compiler is **4.13.1**. We recommend installing Coq and the required packages via OPAM. [The official page of OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) describes how to install and configure OPAM, and [the official page of Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html) describes how to install Coq and Coq packages with OPAM. 

We have tested on our machine that after executing `opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released` according to the official page of Coq, running the following commands can install all required packages for compiling our project:

```
opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect=2.1.0
opam install coq-mathcomp-zify coq-mathcomp-algebra coq-mathcomp-fingroup coq-mathcomp-finmap
opam install coq-flocq
opam install coq-vcfloat --ignore-constraints-on=coq
```

The flag `--ignore-constraints-on` is necessary for working around some version constraints. 

### Build the Coq Project

Execute the following command in the terminal: 

```
make
```

Please note that warnings (in yellow colour) may appear during the compilation, but they will not cause the compilation to fail.

Mechanised proof of the overview case study, presented in Section 4, is located in `experiments/uCSR.v` with all correspondent comments.

### LGTM embedding details

The Coq-specific details of the framework are explained in `Triple.md`. `Triple.md` explains how LGTM specification triples are embedded in the Coq development.

### Recommended order of Artifact Evaluation 

1. `Triple.md` -- explains how LGTM triples are embedded 
2. `experiments/uCSR.v` -- explains the mechanised proof of Section 4 from the paper, as well as other uCSR related proofs.
3. `experiments/SV.v` -- explains the mechanised proofs related to operations on SV format.
4. `experiments/CSR.v` -- explains the CSR format. Mechanised proofs in `experiments/CSR.v` are similar to ones in `experiments/uCSR.v`.
5. Other `experiments/*` files
6. Files with metatheory mechanisation
